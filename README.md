# Data_cleaning-NYC
This repository contains my work on cleaning the New York City Airbnb Open Data. The project focuses on handling missing values, standardizing data types, and addressing potential outliers within the dataset. The goal is to prepare a clean and reliable dataset suitable for further exploratory data analysis and modeling.
